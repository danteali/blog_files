Repo to host some files which I'll be linking to from Blogger or my Wordpress blog.

Mostly scripts used in NAS and Raspberry Pi configuration.

Blogger can't really be used to host files and I don't want to store much on my Wordpress host. 

I don't want to write out the whole of these scripts in a blog post. Much easier to link here.


===========================================
How to use git (reminder for myself on how to add more stuff to the repo!)

cd ~/git-repo/blog-repo/

git add .
- This adds in all of your files & changes so far to a staging area.

git commit -m "whatever"
git push -u origin master
