Repo to host some files which I'll be linking to from Blogger or my Wordpress blog.

Mostly scripts used in NAS and Raspberry Pi configuration.

I don't want to store much on my Wordpress host to minimise hosting costs.

I also don't want to write the entirity of each scripts in a blog post as they are typically too long for that. Much easier to link here.


===========================================
How to use git (reminder for myself on how to add more stuff to the repo)

cd ~/git-repo/blog-repo/

git add .
- This adds in all of your files & changes so far to a staging area.

git commit -m "whatever"
git push -u origin master
